# WikDict TEI importer

Import TEI files generated by [WikDict] into FreeDict. These dictionaries contain data originally created at Wiktionary.

[WikDict]: http://www.wikdict.com 

## Usage

Go to the fd-dictionaries directory which contains all FreeDict dictionaries and execute

    # execute importer, adjust path if necessary
    ~/freedict/tools/importers/wikdict/import_wikdict.py

This creates new directories (or replaces existing ones) for the imported dictionaries. Then use make as for all other FreeDict dictionaries.
