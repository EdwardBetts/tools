This directory contains all importer scripts and programs to automatically
import new dictionaries. If an importer is specific to a particular dictionary,
a name with the appropriate language code should be used. For instance, an
importer for Danish-German should be called dan-deu.
Importer scripts which import dictionaries from a certain project should be
named after the project.

Each dictionary importer should have a README with basic instructions on how to
run and configure the importer. Furthermore, importers should be documented on
the
[import centre](https://github.com/freedict/fd-dictionaries/wiki/Import-Centre).
