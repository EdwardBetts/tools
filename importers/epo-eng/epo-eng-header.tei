        <p>This dictionary has been parsed from a plain text file. Although the
        parser attempts to be clever, it might well be that certain text
        fragments are categorized as grammatical information, or vice versa.
        Please report these issues to the maintainer or to the FreeDict project.</p>
        <p>The original dictionary has been changed at a few places. These
        changes are mostly to make the dictionary better parseable.</p>
